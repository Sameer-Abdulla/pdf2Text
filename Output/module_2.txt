 Reasons for studying concepts of programming languages
O
To improve your ability to develop effective
algorithms.
PRINCIPLES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES
0
To improve the use of existing programming
languages
• To allow a better choice of programming language
To make it easier to learn a new language.
• To make it easier to design a new language

Language Evaluation Criteria
4 characteristics.
1. Readability for software maintanance
2. Writability
3. Reliability.
4. Cost

Readability - The ease which you can read and
understand the program.
a) Overall simplicity a language having less no
of features are better than languages having
large number of features.
b) Feature multiplicity - Less feature multiplicity
is the better. eg: count
c) Operator Overloading - Reduces readability.
c=a+b.
= count +1, Count += 1, count++
d) Orthogonality (simplicity)

To make the program more readable,
Reduce the control statements
- goto statement and target statement
should be closer to each othere.
goto statement should precede the target
statement.
e) Control Statements

f) Datatypes and Structures
Appropriate datatypes and structures should
be there for better readability
9) Syntax Consideration
Syntax : The way in which the
i) Identifier forms.
which the program appears.
Identifier should have enough length to
Convey the meaning.
eg: : stud-name for student name
ii) Special words
loudy
Special words is generally not used as
variable. It is used for a specific purpose.
kg: In C, for is used for loop statement.
opini) Form and Meaning
.
In terms of readability, one meaning for a
form is better.
Writability. spinos
The ease with which we can write a program
Factors influencing writability,
1. Simplicity and Orthogonality..
Language having less number of features
are better.
2. Support for Abstraction.
Two types of abstraction
These features increases writability.
3. Expressivity.
Process abstraction
- Data abstraction
How easily we can express/ write a program
count++ is more expressive than count += 1 pr
Reliability.
Under all circumstances, a program should give
expected output
i) Type Checking
to swalt gullion
Checking that each operator receives
proper number of arguments of proper data type.
Compile time type checking Eg: C, C++, Java
Run time type checking - Eg: Python, Ada
2. Exception handling.
To handle run time errors.
Eg: Division by 0
3. Aliasing
Different names are given for the same memory cell.

Describing Syntax and Sematics.
Syntax - The form of expressions, statements and
program units is called syntax of a programming
language.
Semantics - The meaning of expressions, statements
and program unit is called semantics of
programming language about media
Lexeme
the
the programme.
-
Lowest syntatic unit of a programming
language.
Eg: a = b + c * Q.
that category is
Eg: a, b, c etc
+,-, * etc
a = b... all are lexeme
Token - These lexemes belongs to some category,
called token.
belong to the token 'identifier !
belong to the token' operator?
Grammar - The notation used to specify the syntax
of a programming language
.
A scientist named Chomsky classified
into 4 types. They are:
· Type 1
Type O

Type 2 Syntax of PL

Quantities Involved in Grammar
pong
prins4 quantities are involved in grammar. They are:
i) Terminal : The basic unit of a PL.
iii) Start Symbol: One of the non terminal is
selected as the start symbol.
iv) Production Rule.

i) Non-terminal denotes set of strings (can be further
expanded)
